# FlexiPlasmidDraw
__Client-side standalone__ Plasmid illustration drawing(SVG) for biotech use.

Created in 2008, before the HTML5 or whatever JS framework era.

This is a javascript-based tool for drawing plasmid and retriving the image as vector SVG commands. Useful for quickly creating an illustration for presentation use, or __when the actual DNA sequence does not matter__.

SVG file can be edited using WYSIWYG editor Inkscape or Illustrator, or even a plain text editor, and can be enlarged without degrading image quality.

You can download everything on to your own PC and then just run __index.html__, then select either Basic OR Deluxe version to run.

All mordern browsers as of 2015 should be able to render SVG so you can forget about the Basic version actually.

## Difference from other tools
* Vector NTI/pDraw and other payware: This is free and better suitable for simple illustration purpose
* Savvy: This is client-side only and offer more features
* AngularPlasmid: This is more light-weight and gives you the actual SVG code, but less features
