# FlexiPlasmidDraw
Client-side standalone Plasmid illustration drawing(SVG) for biotech use.

Created in 2008, before the HTML5 era.

This is a javascript-based tool for drawing plasmid and retriving the image as vector SVG commands.

SVG file can be edited using WYSIWYG editor Inkscape or Illustrator, or even a plain text editor, and can be enlarged without degrading image quality.

You can download everything on to your own PC and then just run index.html, then select either Basic OR Deluxe version to run.

All mordern browsers as of 2015 should be able to render SVG so you can forget about the Basic version actually.

MIT license. Donation welcome.
