<h2>Explanation on the user interface of the Deluxe version</h2>

<p align="left">Note: The plasmid size is the only field requiring user input while all other fields are optional. If you just enter the plasmid size and nothing else, the program will draw a circle with black outline.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="gf setting help.jpg" alt="global feature settings" width="907" height="302" /></p>
<p align="left">Note: 'Arrow head length' is defined in terms of anglar size (in degree). Setting it to a large value will make the appearance odd. You may also need to reduce the anglar size for features that are very short. Otherwise an odd shape instead of an arrow may be drawn.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="text setting help.jpg" alt="text settings" width="643" height="227" /></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Important note on 'Text Location':</strong> If you choose 'curve inside feature', you will not see any feature text in the preview area. However, after you save the SVG code as a new file and open it with Firefox or Inkscape, the text should be visible.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="canvas setting help.jpg" alt="canvas settings" width="274" height="89" /></p>
<p align="left">The canvas size defines the size of the drawing board. It limits the maximum size of the plasmid map and also defines the center of the map's circle. The center of circle (x,y) is defined to be (Width*0.5, Height*0.5). Hence you may draw a series of non-concentric circles/features by appending features with different canvas size settings. The program will alert you if the plasmid map is too large to be fitted in the canvas.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you press the 'Append Feature' button without pressing the 'Generate Code' button before(i.e. the SVG code panel is empty), the program may yield unexpected/invalid results.</p>
